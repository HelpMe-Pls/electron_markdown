# Markdown Utils

Inspired by the instructions from [this course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/electron-v2/)

This project has its built version as a desktop app (only available on Windows, for now), which you can find in the folder `build/Markdown Utils-win32-x64/Markdown Utils.exe`.

Markdown files format can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
