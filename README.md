# Markdown Utils

Inspired by the instructions from [this course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/electron-v2/)

## Usage
This project has its built version as a desktop app (only available on Windows, for now), which you can download and extract the [source code](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/electron_markdown/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) then find the executable app in folder `electron_markdown/build/Markdown Utils-win32-x64/Markdown Utils.exe`.

Markdown files format can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)

The project also serves as a crash reporter for [electron-clip-with-testing](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/electron-clip-with-testing#readme) 
## Installation

If you want to run the project in **dev mode**, make sure to have the same environment as I do to get it working properly. Please download and install these 2 softwares if you don't have them already:
1.  **nvm-setup.zip** from its [latest release](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
2.  [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Then open up your terminal with Admin privilege and run:
1. `nvm install 14.15.0` 
2. `nvm use 14.15.0` 
3. `node -v` (the output should be `v14.15.0`)
4. Pick a folder of your choice *or* create an empty folder and then `cd path-to-that-folder`
5. `git clone https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/electron_markdown.git`
6. `cd electron_markdown`
7. `npm i`
8. `npm start`
